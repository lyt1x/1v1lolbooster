# 1v1.lol Elo Boosting Script

  This was a tool that automated winning competitive games. It completely broke the elo system. The highest legitimately known elo before the boosters was around ~5000, but afterwards, the highest known elo reached around ~60 million
  I created it in early 2021 by figuring out how to send a POST request to the game's database. Doop did the same, since we were in the same clan. By mid-2021, roughly a quarter to a third of the active players had either: 1) paid for the boost, 2) gotten their ELO boosted because they knew someone with a booster, 3) been given a booster by someone, or 4) created their own booster
  Here's what the program looked like (this isn't the actual boosting process, it's just a template, since boosting is impossible nowadays, and I can't find old pictures of me using the booster because my previous Discord account got banned)
